                        Apache Airflow® has a modular architecture and uses a message queue to orchestrate an arbitrary number of workers. Airflow™ is ready to scale to infinity.

                        Apache Airflow® pipelines are defined in Python, allowing for dynamic pipeline generation. This allows for writing code that instantiates pipelines dynamically.
